## General
- Fixed all build problems for GCC and clang on various platforms
  (up to OS-X 10.10)

  libstdc++ the user is responsible for thread-safety when using
  casacore ojbects.

- Changed namespace from casa to casacore (but still #defined as
  casa for time being)
- Split Tables, MeasurementSets and Lattices into smaller parts

  in casacore/changescripts (notably updateall) can be used to fix
  client code.
