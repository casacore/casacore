# Casacore

A suite of c++ libraries for radio astronomy data processing.


# Installation

## Obtaining the source

The casacore source code is maintained on github.

You can obtain it using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/casacore/casacore
```

## Requirements

To compile casacore you need to meet the following requirements:

* cmake
* gfortran
* g++
* flex 
* bison
* blas
* lapack
* cfitsio (3.181 or later)
* wcslib (4.20 or later)
* sofa (optional, only for testing casacore measures)
* fftw3 (optional)
* hdf5 (optional)
* numpy (optional)
* boost-python (optional)
* ncurses (optional)

On Debian / Ubuntu you can install these with:
 ``` 
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake gfortran g++ libncurses5-dev \
    libreadline-dev flex bison libblas-dev liblapacke-dev libcfitsio3-dev \
    wcslib-dev 
```

and the optional libraries:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev libfftw3-dev python-numpy \
    libboost-python-dev libpython3.4-dev libpython2.7-dev
```

On CentOS7 you can install these with:
 ```bash 
$ sudo yum install cmake cmake-gui gcc-gfortran gcc-c++ flex bison \
        blas blas-devel  lapack lapack-devel cfitsio cfitsio-devel \
        wcslib wcslib-devel ncurses ncurses-devel readline readline-devel\
        python-devel boost boost-devel fftw fftw-devel hdf5 hdf5-devel\
        numpy boost-python 
```

## Obtaining measures data

Various parts of casacore require measures data, which requires regular
updating. You can obtain the WSRT measures archive from the ASTRON FTP server:

ftp://ftp.astron.nl/outgoing/Measures/

Extract this somewhere on a permanent location on your filesystem.


## Compilation

In the casacore source folder run:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
make install
```

there are various flags available to cmake to enable and disable options:
```
$ cmake -DUSE_FFTW3=ON -DDATA_DIR=/usr/share/casacore/data -DUSE_OPENMP=ON \
    -DUSE_HDF5=ON -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON -DUSE_THREADS=ON
```

The `DATA_DIR` should point to the location where you extracted the measures
data. Special variables `%CASAROOT%` and `%CASAHOME%` can be used here, which can be set at run time through the `.casarc` file.

We have expirmental support for Python3 now. You can build python3 support using
`-DBUILD_PYTHON3=on`. Note that CMake may have problems detecting the correct
python3 libraries and headers, so probably you need to set them manually. For
example:
```
-DPYTHON3_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.4m.so
-DPYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.4
```

To configure Python2 specific settings use:
```
PYTHON2_EXECUTABLE
PYTHON2_LIBRARY
PYTHON2_INCLUDE_DIR
```

To configure Python3 specific settings use:
```
PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE
PYTHON3_LIBRARY
PYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR
```

If you run into problems with boost libraries, try setting `-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=True`. This will be necessary if you have the libraries from NRAO casa in your PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

## Ubuntu 14.04 packages

If you run Ubuntu 14.04 you can use precompiled binary packages

https://launchpad.net/~radio-astro/+archive/ubuntu/main

installation commands:
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:radio-astro/main
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install casacore2 casacore-data
```
