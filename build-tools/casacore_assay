# Usage: assay <testexe and arguments>
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# assay invokes a casacore test program. If the test program has an associated
# .run file then it simply invokes it.  Otherwise assay invokes the test
# executable directly, and, if there is a corresponding .out file, compares
# its output with that.
#
# The env.var. CASACORE_CHECK can be defined to do checking using tools
# like valgrind. It defines a script that will execute the command. The
# script can invoke the checking tool. If set to 1, yes, or YES, the script
# casacore_memcheck will be used that uses valgrind's memcheck tool.
#
# If there is a .in file associated with the test program then assay will
# redirect stdin from it.
#
# Options:
#   none
#
# Status returns:
#    0:  success
#    1:  test execution failed
#    2:  test output disagreement
#    3:  untested (usually returned from a .run)
#  130:  interrupt
#
# Notes:
#    1) It is assumed that the test executable exists in the current PATH.
#       If an environment variable called ASSAYBIN exists then ".:$ASSAYBIN"
#       is added to the start of PATH.  The AIPS++ system bintest directory is
#       always appended to PATH.
#       If an environment variable ASSAYPY exists, it is added to PYTHONPATH.
