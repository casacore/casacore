// LogicalArray declares logical valued Arrays.

//
// <synopsis>
// This file contains the declarations for LogicalArrays.
// </synopsis>
//
// <motivation>
// One needs to have logical valued Arrays.  They are the result of
// logical operations on Arrays.  They can also be created in other ways.
// They are used as masks for MaskedArrays.
//
// Array<Bool> would have served the purpose.  However, it is very space
// inefficient.  Instead, the concept has been abstracted.  Currently,
// the implementation of LogicalArray is Array<LogicalArrayElem>, done
// with typedefs.  The type of LogicalArrayElem can be changed at any time.
// Later, if desired, LogicalArray can be made to be a true class, without
// requiring more than a recompile of code which uses it.
// </motivation>
//
// <todo asof="$DATE:$>
//   <li> Consider making these into classes.
//   <li> Consider replacing with builtin boolean class when that
//          makes it into the C++ compiler.
