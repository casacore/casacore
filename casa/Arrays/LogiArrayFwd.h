// <etymology>
// LogiArrayFwd is short for LogicalArrayForwards, which is too long by
// AIPS++ file naming conventions.  It contains forwards for LogicalArrays.
// </etymology>
//
// <synopsis>
// This file contains forward definitions for LogicalArrays.
// </synopsis>
//
// <motivation>
// There are places where LogicalArrays cannot be defined, i.e. where
// LogiArray.h cannot be included.  In those places, one must provide
// forward declarations for those objects which one is using.
// This is particularly tricky for LogicalArrays, since they are not
// classes, but are rather typedefs.  In order to make these forwards
// easier to get correct, and easier to maintain, this file was created.
// If LogicalArrays should ever be change to a class, only this file would
// need to be changed, instead of every file where the current typedefs
// would have to be changed to class forwards.
// </motivation>
//
// <todo asof="$DATE:$>
//   <li> Change LogicalArrayElem char.
//   <li> Consider making these into classes.
//   <li> Consider replacing with builtin boolean class when that
//          makes it into the C++ compiler.
// </todo>

//# Typedefs

// The element type for LogicalArray.
// This should stay a typedef and not a class, so that it will work inside
