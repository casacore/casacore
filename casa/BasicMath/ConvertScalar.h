// <synopsis> 
// Templated functions to convert scalars from one type to another.
// They are useful to be able to convert a DComplex to a Complex
// in templated classes.
// A Complex,DComplex specialisation is necessary because the complex
// class in the standard C++ library does not have such an automatic
// conversion.
