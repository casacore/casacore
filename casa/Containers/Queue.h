//
// <synopsis> 
// A Queue as implemented here is a simple container which can grow with time,
// and which returns its elements (only) in the order they are inserted. That
// is, the fundamental operations are to insert an element in the queue (at the
// "back") and retrieve an element (from the "front").
//
// <srcblock>
//     Queue<Int> queue;
//     Int x;
//     queue(1);                          // enqueue
//     queue.enqueue(2);                  // enqueue
//     queue(3);                          // enqueue
//     queue(4);                          // enqueue
//     queue.dequeue(x);                  // dequeue
//     cout << x << endl;
//     ...
//     while (queue.nelements() > 0) 
//         cout << queue() << " ";        // dequeue
//     cout << endl;
// </srcblock>
//
// Presently the implementation is rather simple. It stores the elements in
// a Block<T> which resizes (exponentially to avoid quadratic behaviour) when
// necessary. New elements are added to the end of the block, old elements are
// pulled off the front of the Block. The positions at the beginning are only
// reclaimed when the queue is empty or the compress() member is called.
//  This implementation is reasonably time
// efficient, but not necessarily space efficient. A more sophisticated
// implementation may be necessary eventually.
//
// To be used in a Queue, a class must have a default constructor, assignment
// operator, and copy constructor.
// </synopsis> 
//
// <motivation>
// This class was written for an application which thought it needed to queue
// up some Glish events while it processed other Glish events. In fact that
// application (Clean) was simplified so that it doesn't presently operate that
// way.
// </motivation>
//
// <todo asof="28OCT94">
//   <li> It is conceivable that an iterator might be useful for this class.
//   <li> If this class is ever heavily used, a more space efficient
//        implementation may be necessary.
// </todo>
