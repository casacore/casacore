  // </prerequisite>

  // <synopsis>
  // This class wraps the HDF5 functions to open, create, or close an
  // HDF5 file.
  // If the file is opened as readonly, it is possible to reopen it for
  // read/write (provided the user has the correct privileges).
  // It is also possible to temporarily close the file and reopen it later.
  // <note> It is ensured that the class and the static function <tt>isHDF5</tt>
  // are also defined if HDF5 is not compiled in. </note>
  // </synopsis> 

  // <motivation>
  // It was overkill to use the HDF5 C++ interface. Instead little wrappers
  // have been written. HDF5File can be embedded in a shared pointer making
  // it possible to share an HDF5 file amongst various HDF5Array objects.
  // </motivation>

    // or environment variables in it will be expanded).
