  // <etymology>
  // BucketMapped uses memory-mapped files for bucket access.
  // </etymology>

  // <synopsis>
  // BucketMapped is similar to class
  // <linkto class=BucketCache>BucketCache</linkto> and is meant to be used by
  // the storage managers of the Table System.
  //
  // It gives access to buckets in a file by means of memory-mapped files.
  // However, its functionality is a subset of BucketCache and is only meant
  // to be used by the Tiled Storage Managers. If The Standard and Incremental
  // Storage Manager also want to use it, functions like <src>extend</src>
  // needs to be added to this class. Also support for a free bucket list needs
  // to be added.
  // </synopsis> 

  // <motivation>
  // Use of BucketCache is sub-optimal when having large buckets and more or
  // less random IO. Memory-mapping behaves much better.
  // </motivation>

    // The file part mapped into memory starts at startOffset. Its length is

    // If the file is smaller, the remainder is indicated as an extension
    // similarly to the behaviour of function extend.
