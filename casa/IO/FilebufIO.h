// <summary> Class for buffered IO on a file.</summary>

// <use visibility=export>

// </reviewed>

// <prerequisite> 
//  <li> <linkto class=ByteIO>ByteIO</linkto>
// </prerequisite>

// <synopsis>
// This class is a specialization of class
// <linkto class=ByteIO>ByteIO</linkto>.
// This class is doing IO on a file in a buffered way to reduce the number
// of file accesses as much as possible.
// It is part of the entire IO framework. It can for
// instance be used to store data in canonical format in a file
// in an IO-efficient way
// <br>
// The buffer size is dynamic, so any time it can be set as needed.
// <p>
// It is also possible to construct a <src>FilebufIO</src> object
// from a file descriptor (e.g. for a pipe or socket).
// The constructor will determine automatically if the file is
// readable, writable and seekable.
// </synopsis>

// <example>
// This example shows how FilebufIO can be used with an fd.
// It uses the fd for a regular file, which could be done in an easier
// way using class <linkto class=RegularFileIO>RegularFileIO</linkto>.
// However, when using pipes or sockets, this would be the only way.
// <srcblock>
//    // Get a file descriptor for the file.
//    int fd = open ("file.name");
//    // Use that as the source of AipsIO (which will also use CanonicalIO).
//    FilebufIO fio (fd);
//    AipsIO stream (&fio);
//    // Read the data.
//    Int vali;
//    Bool valb;
//    stream >> vali >> valb;
// </srcblock>
// </example>

// <motivation> 
// The stdio package was used, but it proved to be very slow on SOlaris.
// After a seek the buffer was refreshed, which increased the number
// of file accesses enormously.
// Also the interaction between reads and writes in stdio was poor.
// </motivation>
