// <synopsis> 
// This class handles file locking by means of a special lock file
// which serves as the locking mechanism for another file or
// group of files. It is for instance used to lock a table in
// the Casacore Table System.
// <p>
// The lock file has in principle world read/write access, so every
// process accessing the main file can write information in it.
// The lock file contains the following information (in canonical format):
// <ul>
// <li> A request list indicating which processes want to acquire a lock.
//      The process holding the lock can inspect this list to decide if it
//      should release its lock. An interval can be defined to be sure
//      that the list is not inspected too often.
//      A user can choose not to add to this list, because it incurs some
//      overhead to write the list. However, that should only be done when
//      one is sure that another process cannot keep a lock forever.
// <li> Some information telling if the state of the main file has changed.
//      The information can be used by a process to synchronize its
//      internal buffers with the new contents of the file(s).
//      E.g. a table could store one or more counters in it, which can be
//      used to determine if the table has to refresh its caches.
//      This information is passed as a MemoryIO object and is opaque
//      for the <src>LockFile</src> class. It is simply handled as a
//      stream of bytes.
// </ul>
// <p>
// Acquiring a lock works as follows:
// <ul>
//  <li> Class <linkto class=FileLocker>FileLocker</linkto> is used
//   to do one attempt to acquire a read or write lock.
//  <li> If it fails and multiple attempts have to be done, the
//   request is added to the request list in the lock file to tell
//   the process holding the lock that another process needs a lock.
//  <li> Other attempts (with 1 second intervals) will be done until the
//   lock is acquired or until the maximum number of attempts is reached.
//  <li> The lock request is removed from the request list.
//  <li> When the lock was acquired, the synchronization info is read
//   from the lock file.
// </ul>
// Releasing a lock writes the synchronization info into the lock file
// and tells <src>FileLocker</src> to release the lock.
// <p>
// When the lock file cannot be opened as read/write, it is opened as
// readonly. It means that the request list cannot be stored in it,
// so the process has no way to tell the other processes it wants
// access to the file. It has to wait until the lock is released.
// <br> In principle a lock file should always be there. However, it
// is possible (with a constructor option) that there is no lock file.
// In that case each lock request succeeds without doing actual locking.
// This mode is needed to be able to handle readonly tables containing
// no lock file.
// <p>
// After each write the <src>fsync</src> function is called to make
// sure that the contents of the file are written to disk. This is
// necessary for correct file synchronization in NFS.
// However, at the moment this feature is switched off, because it
// degraded performance severely.
// <p>
// Apart from the read/write lock handling, the <src>LockFile</src>
// also contains a mechanism to detect if a file is opened by another
// process. This can be used to test if a process can safely delete the file.
// For this purpose it sets another read lock when the file gets opened.
// The function <src>isMultiUsed</src> tests this lock to see if the file is
// used in other processes.
// <br> This lock is also used to tell if the file is permanently locked.
// If that is the case, the locked block is 2 bytes instead of 1.
// <p>
// When in the same process multiple LockFile objects are created for the same
// file, deleting one object releases all locks on the file, thus also the
// locks held by the other LockFile objects. This behaviour is due to the way
// file locking is working on UNIX machines (certainly on Solaris 2.6).
// One can use the test program tLockFile to test for this behaviour.
// </synopsis>

// <example>
// <srcblock>
// // Create/open the lock file (with 1 sec inspection interval).
// // Acquire the lock and get the synchronization info.
// LockFile lock ("file.name", 1);
// MemoryIO syncInfo;
// if (! lock.acquire (syncInfo)) {
//     throw (AipsError ("Locking failed: " + lock.message()));
// }
// while (...) {
//      ... do something with the table files ...
//      // Test if another process needs the files.
//      // If so, synchronize files and release lock.
//      if (lock.inspect()) {
//         do fsync for all other files
//         syncInfo.seek (0);
//         syncInfo.write (...);
//         lock.release (syncInfo);
//         // At this point another process can grab the lock.
//         // Reacquire the lock
//         lock.acquire (syncInfo);
//             throw (AipsError ("Locking failed: " + lock.message()));
//         }
//     }
// }
// </srcblock>
// </example>

// <motivation> 
// Make it possible to lock and synchronize tables in an easy and
// efficient way.
// </motivation>
