// Memory-mapped IO on a file.
// </summary>

// <synopsis>
// Memory-mapped IO lets the OS take care of caching file segments.
// This is particularly useful for the Tiled Storage Manager which keeps a
// cache of tiles. When using memory-mapped IO it does not need to do that
// anymore.
//
// On 32-bit systems its use is limited because for large files the 4 GB
// memory space is insufficient. However, for 64-bit systems the memory
// space is large enough to make use of it.
//
// In the general case there is direct access to the mapped file space.
// The read and write methods copies the data into/from a buffer.
// However, to avoid the copying it is possible to get a direct pointer
// to the mapped data. This should be used with care, because writing to
// it will cause a segmentation if the file is readonly. If the file is
// writable, writing into the mapped data segment means changing the file
// contents.
// </synopsis>
