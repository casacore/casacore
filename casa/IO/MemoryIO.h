// <summary>Class for IO to a memory buffer.</summary>

// <use visibility=export>

// <reviewed reviewer="Friso Olnon" date="1996/11/06" tests="tByteIO" demos="">
// </reviewed>

// <prerequisite> 
//  <li> <linkto class=ByteIO>ByteIO</linkto>
// </prerequisite>

// <synopsis>
// This class is doing IO in a buffer in memory.
// It is part of the entire IO framework. It can for
// instance be used to store data in canonical format in a
// memory string and obtain it later.
// <p>
// The memory buffer can be dynamic, so it will be expanded when needed.
// This is done by allocating a larger buffer, copy the contents and
// throw the old buffer away.
// <br>
// The memory buffer can also be static to be sure that the pointer to
// the buffer will not change.
// The expand size determines if the memory buffer is static or dynamic.
// An expand size zero indicates a static buffer.
// <p>
// The memory buffer is seekable and readable. It depends on the
// constructor whether it is writable.
// <p>
// There are several ways in which the buffer can be created/passed:
// <ul>
//  <li> Dynamic by passing an initial size and an expand size.
//       However, an expand size zero can be used to assure that no more
//       data is written than fits in the initial buffer (so once the
//       buffer is created it gets static).
//       In this way the buffer is readable and writable.
//  <li> Static by passing a const buffer and its length.
//       In this way the buffer is not writable.
//  <li> Dynamic or static by passing a non-const buffer, its length,
//       and an expand size (zero = static, >0 = dynamic)
//     . The OpenOption indicates whether the buffer will be writable.
//       Only for ByteIO::Old it will not be writable.
//       The OpenOption also determines the initial seek position.
//       Usually it is 0, but for ByteIO::Append it is the end of the buffer.
// </ul>
// The user can obtain a pointer to the buffer to extract the
// stored data from it. The length of the data can also be obtained.
// <p>
// Usually this class will be used in combination with, say, CanonicalIO
// and AipsIO.

// <example>
// <srcblock>
//    // Create dynamic (expandable) memory buffer of length 100.
//    // Use that as the sink of RawIO in AipsIO.
//    MemoryIO membuf (100);
//    RawIO rawio (&membuf);
//    AipsIO stream (&rawio);
//    // Write values.
//    stream << (Int)10;
//    stream << True;
//    // Seek to beginning of buffer and read data in.
//    stream.setpos (0);
//    Int vali;
//    Bool valb;
//    stream >> vali >> valb;
//
//    // One can obtain the buffer and its length and use it later.
//    // (e.g. to write it in a non-AipsIO file).
//    uChar* bufptr = membuf.getBuffer();
//    uInt64 length = membuf.length();
//
//    // It can also used to construct another MemoryIO object from it.
//    // The following memory buffer is static and readonly.
//    MemoryIO membuf2 (bufptr, length);
//    membuf2.read (sizeof(vali), vali);
//    membuf2.read (sizeof(valb), valb);
// </srcblock>
// </example>

// <motivation> 
// Make it possible to do IO in a memory buffer.
// The first implementation used strstreambuf from the iostream package.
// However, that did not allow seeking and it was hard to get the length.
// </motivation>

    // The seek pointer is set to the beginning of the buffer, unless
    // told otherwise below.

    //  <dt> New, NewNoReplace and Scratch
    //  <dd> The buffer is empty and is read/write.
