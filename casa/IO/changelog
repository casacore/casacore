Large file support is now the default
 </summary>
 <description>
Until now large file support had to be enabled explicitly by adding
-DAIPS_LARGEFILE to the CPPSTD definition in the local makedefs.
This has been changed such that large file support is enabled by default.
If a system does not support large files, it has to be disabled by adding
-DAIPS_NOLARGEFILE to the CPPSTD definition in the local makedefs.
