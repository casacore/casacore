// Class to deal with Levensthein distance of strings.
// </summary>

// <synopsis>
// The Levenshtein Distance is a metric telling how similar strings are.
// It is also known as the Edit Distance.
//
// The distance tells how many operations (i.e., character substitutions,
// insertions, and deletions are needed to transform one string into another.
// <br>There are several extensions to the basic definition:
// <ul>
//  <li> Treat a swap of adjacent characters as one operation.
//  <li> Give a weight to operations (e.g., insertions and deletions have
//       half the weight of the other operations).
//  <li> Take locality into account. For example, successive substitutions
//       weigh more than non-successive.
//  <li> Extend to wildcarded strings.
// </ul> 
// This class optionally uses the swap extension. Furthermore one can
// optionally ignore blanks. By default both options are used.
//
// The code is based on code written by Anders Sewerin Johansen.
// Calculating the distance is an expensive O(N^2) operation, thus
// should be used with care.
//
// The class is constructed with the source string to compare against.
// Thereafter its <code>match</code> or <code>distance</code>
// function can be used for each target string.
// </synopsis>
