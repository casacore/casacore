Removed unused cat() functions
 </summary>
 <description>
The String class had, what was called, 'zillions' of cat() functions. These functions were nowhere used in the system (the concatenate operators + and += are used in practice), and their presence would make a change to dependency on the standard String class more difficult.

I have removed these cat() functions from the String class (and the tString)

In addition I have removed the hash() function, which was also not used.

AIPS++ RTTI has been removed
 </summary>
 <description>
All home-brew AIPS++ RTTI (TypeInfo.h) has been removed from the system.
It was used in several classes (Array, String, Regex, List, Map).
Effectively it was only used in ArrayIO to write a unique string for
each template instantiation. This is now replaced by a simple string
"Array", which is sufficient for the purposes it was used for.

RTTI was also used for the home-brew exception mechanism, which was
already removed several months ago. Now the class ExcpError (with
its thrownFile and thrownLine functions) is also removed.

Derive Regex from RegexBase
 </summary>
 <description>
The String class' interface to the regular expressions has changed from using Regex to using RegexBase.
Regex is derived from RegexBase.
This change makes it possible to have different regular expression classes interface with the String class.
