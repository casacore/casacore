  // a copy when its internal number of references (increased using the
  // assignment operator and copy constructor) is greater than one and a
  // write operation is performed. However the COWptr does not not know
  // how many external references (through normal array functions) there
  // are so it is advisable to always make a copy if other methods of
  // accessing the data are used. If COWptr functions were the only
  // mechanism for accessing the data then I would not need to make the
  // data Readonly.
