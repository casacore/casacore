The original array is:[0, 1, 2, 3]
Array 1 is a reference to it:[0, 1, 2, 3]
Modifying array 1 modifies the original array also:[10, 1, 2, 3]
Or accessing it via the COWptr gives the same answer:[10, 1, 2, 3]
Array 1 has been modified using COWptr functions:[10, 11, 2, 3]
But the normally accessed Array 1 is unchanged:[10, 1, 2, 3]
As is the original array:[10, 1, 2, 3]
as the COWptr has made a copy
