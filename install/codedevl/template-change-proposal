Statement of goals:

To control changes to key components of AIPS++ such as Glish, the 
MeasurementSet, the Table system, etc. To alert users of these components 
to proposed changes and to allow comment prior to the implementation of 
any changes.

Proposed changes:

       - The Project manager will appoint a Czar to oversee change management 
for a particular area and an exploder or exploders for the discussion. The 
Czar may be standing or temporary.

        - A Proposal for change in a particular area is sent to the Czar for
review and possible distribution. The Czar may also originate proposals. 
If a submitted proposal passes review by the Czar, it is sent out to 
the designated exploder. An announcement of the commencement  
of the proposal process is sent to aips2-workers.

        - The Proposal contains:

                * Descriptive title of change
                * Name of person responsible
                * Name of originator of proposal
                * Exploders targeted
                * Time table: 
                        - date of issue, 
                        - deadline for comments, 
                        - expected date of revised proposal, 
                        - deadline for final comments, 
                        - decision date.
                * Statement of goals
                * Proposed changes
                * Expected impact
                * Proposed documentation changes

        - Target dates should be expeditious (a couple of weeks at most). The
decision date will be tracked in the AIPS++ target dates.

        - The expected impact should include both positive and negative
effects.

        - A place for documenting the proposed changes must be identified.

        - All comments to a proposal must be on the exploder and, when
substantially critical, accompanied by a self-consistent counter
proposal or modification.

        - The Czar makes the final decision.

Expected Impact:

The positive impact will be that proposed changes are more widely advertised
and more carefully considered by those concerned. No substantial negative 
impact other than creeping bureaucracy. To avoid the latter, we will only
invoke this procedure for substantial changes.

Proposed documentation changes:

Project management procedures must be documented somewhere. This procedure will
be written down there. The PM will start such a document.
