// <summary>
// Abstract base class for interpolator used by CurvedLattice2D.
// </summary>

// <use visibility=local>

// <reviewed reviewer="" date="" tests="tCurvedLattice2D.cc">
// </reviewed>

// <prerequisite>
//# Classes you should understand before using this one.
//   <li> <linkto class=CurvedLattice2D>CurvedLattice2D</linkto>
// </prerequisite>

// <etymology>
// The CL in CLInterpolator2D means CurvedLattice.
// The 2D means that interpolation in 2 dimensions needs to be done.
// </etymology>

// <synopsis>
// CurvedLattice2D needs lattice data which are not on exact grid points.
// Therefore some interpolation scheme is needed. The abstract base class
// CLInterpolation2D makes it possible for CurvedLattice2D to use any
// interpolation scheme.
// Currently the only derived class is
// <linkto class=CLIPNearest2D>CLIPNearest2D</linkto>
// <br>
// Apart from interpolating and returning data, a derived class also has to
// return a mask. For instance, in a possible derived class using
// 4-point interpolation, the interpolation scheme has to take the
// image mask into account, and make a mask for its output data (say that
// the output point is masked off if its 4 input points are masked off).
//
// This base class has some data members defining the lattice and the
// lattice axes to be interpolated. When these data members are set,
// the virtual function <src>preset</src> is called. A derived class
// can implement this function to do some precalculations, etc..
// </synopsis>

// <motivation>
// This class makes it possible to hide the interpolation to be used
// from the CurvedLattice2D class.
// </motivation>
