// <synopsis>
// This class contains a few static functions to find 1 or 2 fractiles
// in a lattice. They are primarily used by the LEL classes, but can
// also be used standalone.
// <br>
// A fractile is the same as a percentile be it that it is given as a
// fraction instead of a percentage. A fraction of 0.5 yields the median.
// <br>
// When the lattice has a mask, only the masked-on elements are taken into
// account. If all elements are masked_off, an empty Vector is returned
// indicating that no fractiles were found.
// <p>
// The algorithm used depends on the size of the lattice.
// Smallish lattices (i.e. not exceeding the argument smallSize)
// are handled in one pass im memory.
// For bigger lattices a multi-pass algorithm is used. First the
// lattices is binned. Thereafter the algorithm continues with the
// elements of the bins containing the fractiles. This continues
// until the number of elements left is less than <src>smallSize</src>.
// Typically only 2 passes are needed for a big image.
// <br>
// The algorithm is robust and takes possible rounding errors into account.
// It also takes into account that the lattice can contain many equal values.
// </synopsis> 

// <motivation>
// Separated from file LELFunction.h to make it more commonly usable
// and to make the source files more readable.
// </motivation>
