// Abstract base class to monitor progress in lattice operations

// <synopsis>
// This is an abstract base class for classes to monitor the
// progress of an operation on a Lattice. The default implementation
// offered by this class does nothing.
// However, a derived class could show the progress using for example
// a <linkto class=ProgressMeter>ProgressMeter</linkto>. A derived
// class should override the virtual functions from this class.
//
// The user of the LatticeProgress object should first call
// function <src>init</src> with the total number of steps
// that are to be done.   Thereafter, after each step has been
// executed, function <src>nstepsDone</src> should be called
// after each step.  Finally, function <src>done</src> should
// be called.
// </synopsis>

// <example>
// <srcblock>
// </srcblock>
// </example>

// <motivation>
// Since operations on Lattices can take a while, it can be useful
// to show the progress. However, making module Lattices dependent on
// the class ProgressMeter sounded bad. This abstract class serves
// as a bridge between the Lattice module and the ProgressMeter class
// (or any other class showing the progress).
// </motivation>
