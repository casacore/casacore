// Step a Vector cursor optimally through a tiled Lattice.

// </prerequisite>

// <etymology>
// TiledLineStepper is used to step a Vector cursor optimally through
// a Lattice that is tiled.
// </etymology>

// <synopsis> 
// When you wish to traverse a Lattice (say, a PagedArray or an Image) you
// will usually create a LatticeIterator.  Once created, you may attach a
// LatticeNavigator to the iterator. A TiledLineStepper, is a concrete class
// derived from the abstract LatticeNavigator that allows you to move
// a Vector cursor through the Lattice in a way that will minimize the
// amount of cache memory consumed.
// <p>
// Some Lattices (in particular PagedArrays) are stored (on disk) in
// tiles. For an N-dimensional Lattice a tile is an N-dimensional
// subsection with fewer elements along each axis. For example a Lattice of
// shape [512,512,4,32] may have a tile shape of [32,16,4,16], and there
// will be 16*32*1*2 (=1024) tiles in the entire Lattice. To allow efficient
// access of the data in a Lattice some tiles are cached in memory. As each
// tile may consume a fair bit of memory (in this example 128kBytes,
// assuming each element consumes 4 bytes), it is desirable to minimise the
// number of tiles held in the cache. But it is also desirable to minimise
// the number of times a tiles must be read into or written from the
// cache as this may require a time consuming operation like disk I/O.
// <p>
// Now suppose you wanted to traverse a Lattice with a Vector cursor of
// length 512 pixel aligned along the x-axis. Using a
// <linkto class=LatticeStepper>LatticeStepper</linkto>, each Vector is
// retrieved from the Lattice sequentially and without any consideration of
// the underlying tile shape. What is the optimal cache size for the above
// example?
// <p>
// Suppose we have a cache size of 16 ie., the number of tiles along the
// x-axis. Then Vectors beginning at positions [0,0,0,0] to [0,15,0,0] will
// be stored in the cache. But the next Vector beginning at position
// [0,16,0,0] will flush the cache and read in another 16 tiles. This I/O
// takes time and will occur 16 times for each plane in the four dimensional
// Lattice. Further when the cursor moves to position [0,0,1,0] the 16 tiles
// that where initially in the cache will need to be read again. To avoid
// all this cache I/O it is better to have a bigger cache.
// <p>
// Suppose the cache size is 16*32 (=512) ie., enough tiles to contain an
// (x,y)-plane. Then the cache size will not be flushed until the cursor is
// moved to position [0,0,0,16]. Further the cache will never need to read
// back into memory tiles that had previously been stored in there. The
// cache is big enough to store tiles until they have been completely
// used. But this cache is 64MBytes in size, and consumes too much memory
// for many computers.
// <p>
// This where a TiledLineStepper is useful. Because it knows the shape of the
// tiles in the underlying Lattice it moves the cursor to return all the
// Vectors in the smallest possible cache of tiles before moving on to the
// next set of tiles. Using the above example again, the TiledLineStepper will
// move the beginning of the Vector cursor in the following pattern.
// <srcblock>
// [0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0], [0,2,0,0], ... [0,15,0,0]
// [0,0,1,0], [0,1,1,0],            ... [0,15,1,0], 
//                                  ... [0,15,3,0],
// [0,0,0,1], ...                       [0,15,3,15]
// </srcblock>
// Moving the Vector cursor through all 16*4*16 (=1024 positions) can be
// done by caching only 16 tiles in memory (those along the x-axis). Hence
// the cache size need only be 2MBytes in size. Further once all 1024
// vectors have been returned it is not necessary to read these 16 tiles
// back into memory. All the data in those tiles has already been
// accessed. Using a TiledLineStepper rather than a LatticeStepper has,
// in this example, resulted in a drop in the required cache size from
// 64MBytes down to 2MBytes. 
// <p>
// In constructing a TiledLineStepper, you specify the Lattice shape, the
// tile shape and the axis the Vector cursor will be aligned with. Specifying
// an axis=0 will align the cursor with the x-axis and axis=2 will produce a
// cursor that is along the z-axis. The length of the cursor is always the
// same as the number of elements in the Lattice along the axis the cursor
// is aligned with.
// <br>It is possible to use the function <src>subSection</src> to
// traverse only a subsection of the lattice.
// <p>
// The cursor position can be incremented or decremented to retrieve the next
// or previous Vector in the Lattice. The position of the next Vector in the
// Lattice will depend on the tile shape, and is described above. Within a tile
// the Vector cursor will move first through the x-axis and then the y-axis
// (assuming we have a cursor oriented along the z-axis). In general the lower
// dimensions will be exhausted (within a tile) before moving the cursor
// through higher dimensions. This intra-tile behaviour for cursor movement
// extends to the inter-tile movement of the cursor between tiles. 
// </synopsis> 

// <example>
// This example is of a global function that will do a 2-D inplace
// complex Fourier transform of an arbitrary large Lattice (which
// must have at least two dimensions).
//
// A two dimensional transform is done by successive one dimensional
// transforms along all the rows and then all the columns in the
// lattice. Scoping is used to destroy iterators once they have been
// used. This frees up the cache memory associated with the cursor in each
// iterator.
