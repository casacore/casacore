// <synopsis>
// This module extends TaQL (the Table Query Language) with functions handling
// measures. Currently it can handle directions, epochs, and positions.
//
// These functions make it possible to convert one or more measures from
// one reference type and frame to another. For example, to convert a
// direction from J2000 to apparent one can specify the direction in J2000
// as well as a time and position to define the measure frame like:
// <srcblock>
//     calc meas.app ([4h23m32.7, 34d11m54.8], "J2000",
//                    datetime(), "UTC", POSITION) from my.ms/ANTENNA
// </srcblock>
// The above example converts the given J2000 direction to apparent coordinates
// for the given time (current time is used) and for all positions in the
// POSITION column in the given ANTENNA table.
//
// As shown in the example an argument of a <src>meas</src> function can be
// a constant, a table column in a table. or any expression.
// If a table column is given, it is recognized if the column has a reference
// type attached to it (using the TableMeasures). In this example it
// would be recognized that the positions in the POSITION column are given
// as, say, WGS84.
// <br>For constants the reference type can be given in case it differs from
// the default type. In the example UTC is specified for the time (was not
// necessary because it is the default).

// <note>
// The meas library will be loaded dynamically by TaQL when such a function
// is used. Therefore it is important that the library and the other casacore
// libraries are built shared.
// <br>It is also important that the library can be found in the
// (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
// </note>
// </synopsis> 
//
// <motivation>
// It is very handy to be able to convert emasures in tools that
// deal with various table columns (e.g. TaQL, TablePlot, pyrap).
// </motivation>
