*
*  Transform Hipparcos star data into the FK5 (J2000) system.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given (all Hipparcos, epoch J2000):
*     RH        d      RA (radians)
*     DH        d      Dec (radians)
*     DRH       d      proper motion in RA (dRA/dt, rad/Jyear)
*     DDH       d      proper motion in Dec (dDec/dt, rad/Jyear)
*     PXH       d      parallax (arcsec)
*     RVH       d      radial velocity (positive = receding)
*
*  Returned (all FK5, equinox J2000, epoch J2000):
*     R5        d      RA (radians)
*     D5        d      Dec (radians)
*     DR5       d      proper motion in RA (dRA/dt, rad/Jyear)
*     DD5       d      proper motion in Dec (dDec/dt, rad/Jyear)
*     PX5       d      parallax (arcsec)
*     RV5       d      radial velocity (positive = receding)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) This routine transforms Hipparcos star positions and proper
*     motions into FK5 J2000.
*
*  2) The proper motions in RA are dRA/dt rather than
*     cos(Dec)*dRA/dt, and are per year rather than per century.
*
*  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
*     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are
*     not taken into account.
*
*  4) See also iau_FK52H, iau_FK5HZ, iau_HFK5Z.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_STARPV  star catalog data to pv-vector
*     iau_FK5HIP  FK5 rotation and spin wrt to Hipparcos
