*
*  Mean obliquity of the ecliptic, IAU 1980 model.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2     d      TDB date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_OBL80       d      obliquity of the ecliptic (radians, Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*             DATE1         DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The result is the angle between the ecliptic of J2000 and the mean
*     equator of date DATE1+DATE2.
