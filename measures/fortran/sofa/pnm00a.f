*
*  Form the matrix of precession-nutation for a given date (including
*  frame bias), IAU 2000A model.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2    d       TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     RBPN         d(3,3)    bias-precession-nutation matrix (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(date) = RBPN * V(GCRS), where
*     the p-vector V(date) is with respect to the true equatorial triad
*     of date DATE1+DATE2 and the p-vector V(J2000) is with respect to
*     the mean equatorial triad of the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System (IAU, 2000).
*
*  3) A faster, but slightly less accurate result (about 1 mas), can be
*     obtained by using instead the iau_PNM00B routine.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_PN00A   bias/precession/nutation, IAU 2000A
