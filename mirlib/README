This code is a subset of the MIRIAD I/O library. The MIRIAD package is
a package developed for BIMA and actively being used by BIMA and ATNF
for their offline calibration and data reduction needs.

More details on the MIRIAD package can be found on:

	http://bima.astro.umd.edu/bima/miriad/
or	http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/miriad/

Although the BIMA and ATNF versions use a slightly different directory
structure (January 1997), the source code is essentially the same. You 
should be able to find all subroutines in $MIR/src/subs, except for
miriad.h, which was specifically generated for the AIPS++ project.
MIRIAD V3 (the BIMA version of MIRIAD) has been placed under CVS control,
mirlib is a direct extraction of that release (June 2001).
A new version of this library will be needed to deal with 
large (>2GB) files, which is to be extracted from the CARMA version
of MIRIAD (2011).

Most of the low level C code was developed by Bob Sault
(rsault@atnf.csiro.au).

Correspondence concerning MIRLIB should be directed to Peter Teuben
(teuben@astro.umd.edu).
