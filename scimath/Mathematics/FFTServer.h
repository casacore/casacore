// </etymology>


// <synopsis>

// The FFTServer class provides methods for performing n-dimensional Fast
// Fourier Transforms with real and complex Array's of arbitrary size and
// dimensionality. It can do either real to complex, complex to real, or
// complex to complex transforms with the "origin" of the transform either at
// the centre of the Array or at the first element.

// Because the output from a real to complex transform is Hermitian only half
// of the complex result is returned. Similarly with a complex to real
// transform only half of the complex plane is required, the other half is
// implicitly assumed to be the complex conjugate of the supplied half-plane.
// <note role=warning> The complex to real transform does not check that the
// imaginary component of the values where u=0 are zero</note>

// This class can be initialised with a shape that indicates the length of the
// transforms that will be performed, and whether they are going to be
// real<->complex transforms or complex<->complex ones. This initialisation
// sets up a variety of internal buffers and computes factorizations and
// twiddle factors used during the transform. The initialised transform shape
// is always compared with the shape of the supplied arguments when a transform
// is done and the FFTServer class will automatically resize itself if
// necessary. So the default constructor is perfectly safe to use.

// With any transform the output Array must either be the correct shape for the
// desired output or zero length (ie not contain any elements). If it is zero
// length then it will be resized to the correct shape. For a complex->complex
// transform the output Array will be the same shape as the input Array. For a
// real->complex transform the output Array will be the same size as the input
// Array except in the first dimension which will have a length of (nx+2)/2. So
// if nx=7 the output length will be 4 and if nx=8 the output length will be 5,
// on the first axis. nx is the length of the first axis on the <em>real</em>
// input Array and cx (which is used later) is the length of the first axis on
// the <em>complex</em> input Array.

// <strong>For complex to real transforms the output length on the first axis
// is not uniquely defined by the shape of the complex input
// Array</strong>. This class uses the following algorithm to work out the
// length of the first axis on the output Array.
// <ul> 
// <li> If the size of the output Array is non-zero then its shape must match
// the size of the input Array except for the first axis. The length of the
// first axis must either be 2*cx-2 or 2*cx-1 and this determines the length of
// the transform on the first axis.
// <li> If the size of the output Array is zero then scan the imaginary
// components of the values at the end of the first axis on the input Array (ie
// at <src>[cx-1,....]</src> If any of these are non-zero the output Array
// will have an odd length.
// <li> Otherwise if all the imaginary components described above are zero then
// look at the current size of the FFTServer object (either defined at
// construction time or with the resize function). If it matches the size of
// the input Array except for the first axis and if the length on this axis is
// either 2*cx-2 or 2*cx-1 then use that to determine the size of the output
// Array.
// <li> Otherwise assume the output Array will an even length of 2*cx-2 on its
// first axis.
// </ul>

// This class does transforms using the widely used FORTRAN fftpack
// package.<br>
// <em> P.N. Swarztrauber, Vectorizing the FFTs, in Parallel Computations
// (G. Rodrigue, ed.), Academic Press, 1982, pp. 51--83. </em><br>
// This package only does one dimensional transforms and this class decomposes
// multi-dimensional transforms into a series of 1-dimensional ones.

// In this class a forward transform is defined as one that goes from the real
// to the complex (or the time to frequency) domain. In a forward transform the
// sign of the exponent is negative and no scaling is done on the output.  The
// backward transform goes from the complex to the real (or the frequency to
// the time) domain. The sign of the exponent is positive and the result is
// always scaled by 1/N were N is the total number of elements in the Array.

// The origin of the transform is defined as the point where setting only that
// element to one, and then doing a forward transform results in an Array that
// is all one. The <src>fft</src> member functions in this class all assume
// that the origin of the Transform is at the centre of the Array ie. at
// <src>[nx/2,ny/2,...]</src> were the indexing begins at zero. Because the
// fftpack software assumes the origin of the transform is at the first element
// ie.,<src>[0,0,...]</src> this class flips the data in the Array around to
// compensate. This flipping currently takes about one 20% of the total
// transform time and can be avoided by using the <src>fft0</src> member
// functions which do not flip the data.

// Some of the member functions in this class scramble the input Array,
// possibly by flipping the quandrants of the data although this is not
// guaranteed. Modifification of the input Array can be avoided, at the expense
// of copying the data to temporary storage, by either:
// <ul> <li> Ensuring the input Array is a const Array.
//      <li> Setting the constInput Flag to True.
// </ul>
// The latter option is provided to avoid users having to cast non-const
// Arrays to const ones in order to prevent there input Array from being
// scrambled.

// <note role=warning> This class assumes that a Complex array is stored as
// pairs of floating point numbers, with no intervening gaps, and with the real
// component first ie., <src>[re0,im0,re1,im1, ...]</src>. This means that the
// following type casts work,
// <srcblock>
// S * complexPtr;
// T * realPtr = (T * ) complexPtr;
// </srcblock>
// and allow a Complex number to be accessed as a pair of real numbers. If this
// assumption is bad then real Arrays will have to generated by copying the
// complex ones. Ultimately this assumption about Complex<->Real Array
// conversion should be put somewhere central like Array2Math.cc.
// </note>
// </synopsis>

// <templating arg=T>
// <li> The T argument must be of type Float or Double. These are the only 
// possible instantiations of this class.
// </templating>

// <templating arg=S>
// <li> The S argument must be of type Complex, if T is Float, or DComplex, if T is
// Double. These are the only possible instantiations of this class.
// </templating>
//
// <example>
// Do a real to complex Transform of a 1-Dimensional Vector.  The following
// example can trivially be extended to any number of dimensions.
// <srcblock>
// FFTServer<Float,Complex> server;
// Vector<Float> input(32);
// Vector<Complex> output(17);
// input = 0.0f;
// input(16) = 1.0f;
// cout << "Input:" << input << endl;
// server.fft(output, input);
// cout << "Output:" << output << endl;

//
// <thrown>
// <li> AipsError: If the input and output Array have bad or incompatible
// shapes. See the individual function descriptions for what Array shapes are
// required.
// </thrown>
//
// <todo asof="1997/10/22">
//   <li> The time taken to flip the Array can be reduced, if all the Array
//   dimensions are even, by pre-multiplying the every other element on the
//   input Array by -1. Then no flipping needs to be done on the output Array.
