// <etymology>
// SSMStringHandler handles strings for the Standard Storage Manager.
// </etymology>

// <synopsis>
// Variable length strings cannot be stored in the data bucket.
// Only short (<8 characters) strings can be stored directly.
// Class SSMStringhandler is used by the SSM to store strings in
// so-called string buckets.
// A string bucket has the following layout:
// <ul>
//  <li> The first Int is reserved to be used for the free bucket list.
//  <li> <src>itsUsedLength</src> tells how many bytes have been used.
//       Thus it tells the next free byte in the string part.
//       In principle it always increases. Only if data are removed
//       from the last part of the string part, it is decreased, thus
//       the deleted part can be reused again.
//  <li> <src>itsNDeleted</src> tells how many bytes of the string part
//       are deleted (i.e. not used). Initially it is the length of the
//       string part of the bucket (i.e. bucketsize minus 4 Ints).
//       When a string is stored, its length is subtracted from itsNDeleted.
//       When a string is removed, its length is added again.
//       When the string part is deleted, the bucket is added to the
//       free bucket list.
//  <li> <src>itsNextBucket</src> tells the next bucket if the last
//       entry in the bucket is continued in another bucket.
//       Normally this field is -1 (meaning not continued), but long
//       strings or string arrays might be continued in another bucket
//       (and continued from there again).
//  <li> The string part is a sequence of bytes containing the string
//       data. When a value is to be stored, it will replace the current
//       value if the new value is not longer. Otherwise the current
//       value (if any) is deleted and the new value is appended to
//       the end of the string part in the last bucket used.
//       <p>
//       For a scalar string only its characters are stored. Its length
//       (and bucketnr and offset in string bucket) are stored in the data
//       bucket.
//       <br>
//       A fixed length array is stored as an array of bytes. That byte
//       array contains length-value pairs for each element of the array.
//       The total length (and bucketnr and offset) are stored in the data
//       bucket.
//       <br>
//       A variable length array is stored as the shape, a flag, optionally
//       followed by the string array as length-value pairs (as above).
//       The shape consists of the nr of dimensions followed by the
//       length of each dimension. The flag indicates if a string array
//       is actually stored. It is not if only the shape of the array
//       is set, but no data put yet.
// </ul>
// SSMStringHandler keeps a copy of the current bucket in use to reduce
// the number of accesses to the bucket cache.
// <p>
// It also keeps the bucket number of the last bucket where data were
// added to. It tells which bucket to use when new data has to be stored.
// </synopsis>
