// <synopsis> 
// MemoryStMan is a table storage manager based in memory.
// It holds all data in the columns in memory and deletes them
// when the table gets closed.
// It contains pointers to the underlying MSMColumn objects,
// which do the actual data handling.
//
// The Memory storage manager does fully support addition and removal
// of rows and columns.
//
// The primary use of this storage manager is for a memory-based table,
// but it can also be used for temporary columns in disk-based tables.
// When reopening a disk-based table, possible columns stored with
// MemoryStMan will be initialized to 0.
// An important issue is synchronizing tables containing MemoryStMan
// storage managers in case of concurrent access. Because its data are
// not stored on disk, there is no way to synchronize the data if another
// process changed data or added or deleted rows. If the number or rows
// has changed, rows will be added or deleted as needed. Row deletion
// will be done at the end of the table.
// </synopsis>
