// VirtualColumnEngine is the abstract data manager class for specialized
// classes (engines) handling a group of virtual columns.
// </etymology>

// <synopsis> 
// VirtualColumnEngine is the data manager for classes handling
// a group of virtual columns in tables. It is an abstract base class
// for the specialized virtual column engines.
// Each virtual column as such is represented by a class which has
// to be derived from the abstract base classes VirtualScalarColumn
// or VirtualArrayColumn. The engine has to create the various
// column objects via the functions makeXXXColumn.
//
// Initialization of the virtual column engine is done by the
// functions create (for new tables), open (for existing tables) and prepare.
// The engine can be flushed by the function flush, which allows to
// write some data. The function open can read these data back.
// VirtualColumnEngine is closely related with the table system.
//
// A number of (pure) virtual functions have been defined. The pure
// virtual functions must be implemented in the derived class.
// The non-pure virtual functions have a default implementation throwing
// a "not possible" exception. They need to be implemented if they
// are used for this engine (e.g. makeIndArrColumn does not need to
// be implemented if the engine does not handle arrays).
// Furthermore the pure virtual function dataManagerType (defined in
// DataManager.h) has to be implemented. This should return the name
// of the data manager, which is usually its class name. This name
// has to be unique; so if the engine is templated, the template
// parameter has to be part of the data manager name.
//
// The engine has to be registered before it can be used by the table system.
// This means that a special makeObject function has to be made
// known to the table system, which allows the table system to
// reconstruct the engine using its name.
//
// An example of a virtual column engine can be found in dVirtColEng.{h,cc}
// in the test directory of the Tables module.
// Another exanple is class ScaledArray.
// </synopsis> 

// <motivation>
// It is nice if a table column can be expressed as a function
// of other columns (maybe even in other tables). A virtual column
// provides this functionality in a very flexible way.
// A specialized class can calculate the data of a virtual column,
// but a common base class is required to interface it to the
// table system.
// </motivation>

// <todo asof="$DATE:$">
//# A List of bugs, limitations, extensions or planned refinements.
// </todo>

    // Flush the data in the engine object.
    // If the object contains persistent data, this is the place to write them.
    // This can be done in two ways:
    // <ul>
    // <li>
    // They can be written in the main table file (using the AipsIO argument).
    // This should preferably be used if the object contains only little data.
    // <li>
    // They can be written in a file of its own. A unique filename
    // can be acquired using DataManager::fileName().
    // This way is preferred when the object contains a lot of data.
    // Possibly this file could already be created in function create
    // and only be flushed and closed in this function. This allows
    // getting and putting of data as needed.
    // </ul>
    // Another way of storing information is by storing it as a keyword
    // in the table. In this case it is important to know that close
    // is called AFTER the keywords are written. Thus, in this way the
    // information has to be stored and read back in create, open and/or
    // prepare.
    // It returns a True status if it had to flush (i.e. if data have changed).
    // <br>The default implementation does nothing and returns False.

    // It can be used to initialize variables (possibly using data
    // from other columns in the table).
    // The default implementation does nothing.

    // Initialize the object for an existing table containing nrrow rows.
    // It can be used to read values back (written by close) and/or
    // to initialize variables (possibly using data from other columns
    // in the table).

    // Let the data manager initialize itself further.
    // Prepare is called after create/open has been called for all
    // columns. In this way one can be sure that referenced columns
    // are read back and partly initialized.
    // The default implementation does nothing.
    virtual void prepare();

    // The data manager will be deleted (because all its columns are
    // requested to be deleted).
